Hello, I'm Docta example!
=========================

Now with smart **watch** feature. Cheers!

**Markdown** is awesome, so let's use it for writing docs! Actually, flavored one.

```python
    class Hello(object):
        def say_it(self):
            print("Hello!")


    hello = Hello()
    hello.say_it()
```
